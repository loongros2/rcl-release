  * Updated docs about possibility of rcl_take not taking (#356 <https://github.com/ros2/rcl/issues/356>)
  * Bugfix: ensure NULL timeout is passed to rmw_wait() when min_timeout is not set
    Otherwise, there is a risk of integer overflow (e.g. in rmw_fastrtps) and rmw_wait() will wake immediately.
